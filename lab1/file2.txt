Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.
Example:
“You had a fight with your boss? Are you stupid? Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.”

Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
Example:
“You have 6 hours of free time now. You should start on that final psychology assignment. Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.”

Easy come, easy go.
Example:
“I won $200 at the casino, and then I spent it on a very expensive meal for me and some friends. Easy come, easy go.”
